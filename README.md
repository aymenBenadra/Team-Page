## Overview

![screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)

Well honestly, this project is a tricky one! it challenged me to improve my selection accuracy in CSS and learned about some limitations in SASS nesting  and many other things.
<br>
<br>
I also improved how I use media queries and how to check for break points and much more.
<br>
<br>
Great project for beginners in CSS Grid and Media Queries.
